# Last Shelter: State #365 nPA alliance rules

## 1. Fighting
   Before attacking ANY player ANYWHERE do next things from this checklist. It's ONLY YOUR responsibility to check it.

   1. Don't attack our ALLIES and their FARMS ANYWHERE.

   2. Don't attack [TOP15](./TOP15.md) alliance member if he placed on GREEN ZONE.

   3. Don't attack ANYONE in DESERT if you placed on GREEN ZONE.
   
   4. Don't attack ANYONE in GREEN ZONE if you placed on DESERT.

   Desert is a zone of merciless fight without rules. Almost everything that happens in this territory (AND ONLY THERE) is not governed by STATE rules.

## 2. Chat messaging
   1. Use alliance chat to communicate always.

   2. Don't use state chat at all.

      Before using state chat, check again - maybe alliance chat will be enough.

## 3. Team play
   1. Don't forget about alliance donations (research).

   2. Wendell. Do it every day for yourself and always help your teammates.
   
      Cooperate with your teammates in ALLIANCE chat. Wendell ALWAYS MUST be set to 1 hour. It's recommended to level 5.

   3. Reinforce your teammates if they are attacked and you can really help.
