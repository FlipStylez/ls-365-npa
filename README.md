# Last Shelter: State #365 nPA alliance docs

Welcome to our alliance, we glad to see you!

## Rules
You can read our rules [here](./RULES.md).

## TOP15
You can watch they [here](./TOP15.md). But be careful - it's just a copy! It's in your responsibility to check it explicit in game.

## Hive
It's very recommended for you (if you're new member) to move to hive (especially if you're in the desert). Use a teleport. Check your brifcase. If you haven't then you need to collect diamonds or alliance scores in alliance donations(research).

## Questions
Feel free to ask about what you do not know. We'll always try to help you. Contact the alliance chat or directly to the players of the highest rank.
